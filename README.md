##Mac Os, Ubuntu users continue here:

Create a database locally named test utf8_general_ci
Download composer https://getcomposer.org/download/
Pull Laravel/php project from git provider. https://github.com/xudawww/webdev-challenge
Rename .env.example file to .envinside your project root and fill the database information. (windows wont let you do it, so you have to open your console cd your project root directory and run mv .env.example .env )
Open the console and cd your project root directory
Run composer install or php composer.phar install
Run php artisan migrate
Run php artisan serve


## Thoughts about the laravel project:

In case you can't implement the project, I did the screenshot as following:
![Test Image 4](https://github.com/xudawww/webdev-challenge/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202020-01-24%20at%203.45.16%20PM.png)

I think the best experience I got from this test is that even if the framework is not hard, but keep learning it is mandatory, as the framework updated a lot, and it's different with the framework I learned one year ago. It takes me sometime to finish the test, however, I think I will learn more stuff about the Mysql, PHP if I get admitted by this job position. 



## How it works:

The project is easy to implement, once you upload the file, the form table you want will automatically show up, it shows the monthly expense and the category expense, I add the total table too as a bonus.
